# ModelUI
ModelUI is a generic interface for bespoke models and data analysis tools.

## Licence
The code is provided as Open Source code (issued under a BSD 3-clause License).

## Requirements
ModelUI is written in Matlab(TM) and requires v2016b, or later. In addition, ModelUI requires both the _dstoolbox_ and the _muitoolbox_.

## Background
ModelUI provides a generic interface for modelling applications that produce some combination of graphical and/or time series outputs. The purpose of this user interface (UI) is to enable the rapid prototyping of models by allowing the model developer to focus on the model, rather than the functional or operational needs of the software package itself.  To this end, the UI provides a standard interface with drop-down menus, tools to open and close files, keep track of model runs, provide a rapid means to implement model set-up and data import and export, derivation of new variables, and some basic plotting and statistical tools.

## ModelUI classes
*ModelUI* - defines the behaviour of the main UI.

## Demonstration model classes
* *VPdata* - import vertical profile velocity data.
* *VPmodel* - compute the vertical velocity profile at a point.
* *VPparam* - load the input parameters needed to run the model.

## Manual
The ModelUI manual in the app/doc folder provides further details of setup and configuration of the model. The files for the example use case can be found in
the app/example folder.
